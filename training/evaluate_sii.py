"""
evaluate_sii.py

Evaluation script for the Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) task.

This script loads the refined fuzzy beliefs (output of train_sii.py) and
evaluates them against ground truth using three key metrics from the paper:
1.  Macro F1-Score: For overall classification accuracy.
2.  mean Average Precision (mAP): For object detection performance.
3.  Logical Violation Rate (LVR): To measure logical consistency.

As with the training script, this is a simplified, conceptual implementation
to demonstrate the evaluation logic.
