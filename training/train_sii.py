train_sii.py

Training script for the Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) task.

This script implements the "logical refinement" pipeline described in
Appendix E of the paper. It does not train a model from scratch, but rather
optimizes an initial set of fuzzy beliefs generated by a perception model
to make them consistent with a domain ontology.

Key Workflow:
1.  Load a domain ontology (e.g., for PASCAL-PART).
2.  Simulate a perception model (e.g., FR-CNN) to get initial, noisy fuzzy
    beliefs for objects and parts in an image.
3.  These beliefs are treated as a fuzzy ABox.
4.  The DF-EL++ model's embeddings are used, but the optimization target is
    the fuzzy ABox beliefs, not the model's weights.
5.  Run a refinement loop for a fixed number of epochs to minimize logical
    inconsistency loss.
6.  Save the refined, logically consistent fuzzy beliefs.
